# Configuration

It is necessary to provide a configuration YAML file.

This should have a format similar to:

```yaml
detector: V07302A
measurement: am_HS1_top_dlt
source_position:
  phi_in_deg: 0.0
  r_in_mm: 86.0
  z_in_mm: 3.0
lead_castle_idx: 1
```

It describes the detector to simulate, the measurement, source positions and
which lead castle was used.

:::{note}

The different measurements are described on
[[confluence]](https://legend-exp.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/LEGEND/pages/1826750480/Analysis+of+characterization+data+WIP)
(note this is a private page).
